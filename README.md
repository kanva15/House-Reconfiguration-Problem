# House-Reconfiguration-Problem
Scenario: Imagine managing the layout and organization of a complex house where different rooms and cabinets need to be allocated to residents based on their belongings and preferences. This project focuses on solving the House Reconfiguration Problem (HRP), an abstract version of real-world reconfiguration challenges. The task involves reconfiguring a legacy setup of rooms and cabinets in response to changes in residents' needs and new constraints. For instance, some items might now be classified as long, requiring larger cabinets, while other items may need to be relocated to accommodate these changes. The project explores how to efficiently reallocate resources (rooms and cabinets) to meet the new requirements while minimizing the cost associated with the reconfiguration. 

Challenge: The primary goal of this project is to find an optimal reconfiguration that satisfies all the constraints while minimizing the total cost of changes. Costs are associated with modifying existing cabinets, adding new ones, or removing unused resources. This project involves handling complex constraints related to space allocation, object sizes, and ownership.

Preparation: You will start to write hard constraints from the first milestone and will learn how to write more complex hard constraints in module 4 and module 5. The project will require a deep understanding of constraint satisfaction, which will be developed throughout the course.

Objective: Demonstrate that you can perform automated reasoning about actions using KR tools.
